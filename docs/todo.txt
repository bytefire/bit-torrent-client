(done) 1. test reading a chunk from file
(done) 2. test the creation of meatadata file without extra four fields
(done) 3. add 'pieces' (concatenation of sha1 hashes of all pieces) from torrent file into the metadata file.
(done) 4. verify the piece hashes are correct.
4. write method to load sha1 of a given piece index from metadata file (where will that code go?)
5. compare the computed sha1 with the one extracted from metadata file.
(done) 6. remove util_append_to_file method and replace its calls with fwrite.
7. in util_read_whole_file(), put the single fread inside a loop.
---------------------------------

in pwp.h create a global readonly or const pointer. in pwp_start method, after reading the metadata file, point it to the start of piece_hashes value of metadata file. then in download_piece method, compute the start index of the required piece's sha1.
