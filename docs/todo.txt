1. log file path in client.c is hard coded absolute path. that is because we change working directory when we enter the loff/ folder so we can't use relative path. one solution is to obtain absolute path to log file by using the relative path and then use that path (preferred). alternatively we can not change the working directory at all so working directory always remains the same. then we can use the relative path.
2. in pwp.h, PIECE_STATUS_AVAILABLE etc should be enums.
