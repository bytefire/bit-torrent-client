(done) 1. test reading a chunk from file
(done) 2. test the creation of meatadata file without extra four fields
(done) 3. add 'pieces' (concatenation of sha1 hashes of all pieces) from torrent file into the metadata file.
(done) 4. verify the piece hashes are correct.
(done) 4. write method to load sha1 of a given piece index from metadata file (where will that code go?)
(done) 5. compare the computed sha1 with the one extracted from metadata file.
(done) 6. remove util_append_to_file method and replace its calls with fwrite.
6. test the comparison of sha1's.
7. in util_read_whole_file(), put the single fread inside a loop.
